### Example of a Basic Django Project Structure

```bash
myproject/
    manage.py
    myproject/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
    users/
        migrations/
        templates/
        static/
        admin.py
        apps.py
        models.py
        serializers.py
        urls.py
        views.py
    core/
        ...
    api/
        ...
    admin_panel/
        ...
```

### Considerations

- **Modularity**: Each app should be as modular and self-contained as possible.
- **Reusability**: Aim to create apps that can be reused in different projects.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each app should have a clear responsibility, making your codebase more maintainable.
